/// Object Memory is the main managed storage of the Poietic Design.
///
/// Object Memory contains and manages all objects and their versions as well as
/// structural integrity of the design. The object is represented by its identity
/// and might have multiple version snapshots as ``ObjectSnapshot``.
///
/// ## Identity
///
/// Each object has an identity, and in fact, it is just an identity
/// ``ObjectSnapshot/id-swift.property``.
/// Objects snapshots with the same identity represent different versions of
/// the same object. Each snapshot has a snapshot identity
/// ``ObjectSnapshot/snapshotID``. The snapshot identity is unique in the whole
/// memory.
///
/// ## Frames
///
/// A frame can be thought as a snapshot of the design after a change. Different
/// frames represent different versions of the same design, either in time or
/// as alternatives.
///
/// Think of an object memory as a photo library. The version frame is a picture
/// and the object snapshots are the scene in the picture. The frames might be
/// put in an chronological order to represent the history of design evolution.
/// Or they might be put side-by-side to represent alternate design versions.
///
/// The object memory distinguishes between two states of a version frame:
/// ``StableFrame`` â€“ immutable version snapshot of a frame, that is guaranteed
/// to be valid and follow all required constraints. The ``MutableFrame``
/// represents a transactional frame, which is "under construction" and does
/// not have to maintain integrity.
///
/// ``StableFrame``s can not be mutated, neither any of the object snapshots
/// associated with the frame.
///
/// ``MutableFrame``s are not stored in the archive. See _Archiving_ below.
///
/// The concept of frames allows us to have functionality like undo/redo,
/// version branching, different timelines, sub-system specific annotations
/// without disturbing the original frames, etc.
///
/// ## Editing (Mutating)
///
/// Objects of the design are always changed in a relationship with all
/// other objects within the same frame. When a single change requires mutating
/// multiple objects, all the object changes are grouped into a single change
/// that results in a new frame.
///
/// To make a change and produce a new frame:
///
/// 1. Derive a new frame from an existing one using ``deriveFrame(original:id:)``
///    or create a new empty frame using ``createFrame(id:)`` which produces
///    a new ``MutableFrame``.
/// 2. Add objects to the derived frame using ``MutableFrame/create(_:structuralReferences:components:)``
///    or ``MutableFrame/insert(_:owned:)``.
/// 3. To mutate existing objects in the frame, first derive an new mutable
///    snapshot of the object using ``MutableFrame/mutableObject(_:)`` and
///    make changes using the returned new snapshot.
/// 4. Conclude all the changes by accepting the frame ``accept(_:appendHistory:)``.
///
/// Frame can be accepted only if the constraints are satisfied. When the frame
/// violates ant of the constraints the `accept()` method throws a
/// ``ConstraintViolationError`` with more details about which objects violated
/// which constraints.
///
/// If mutable frame for some reason is not going to be used further, for
/// example if it contains domain errors, it can be discarded using
/// ``discard(_:)``. Discarded frame and its derived object will be removed from
/// the memory.
///
/// ## Archiving
///
/// - ToDo: Design of object memory archive is not yet finished.
///
/// Object memory can be archived (in the future incrementally synchronised)
/// to a persistent store. All stable frames are stored. Mutable frames are not
/// included in the archive and therefore not restored after unarchiving.
///
/// Archive contains only frames that maintain integrity as defined by the
/// metamodel.
///
/// ## Garbage Collection
///
/// - ToDo: Garbage collection is not yet implemented. This is just a description
///   how it is expected to work.
///
/// The memory keeps only those object snapshots which are contained in frames,
/// be it a mutable frame or a stable frame. If a frame is removed, all objects
/// that are referred to only by that frame and no other frame, are removed
/// from the memory as well.
///
/// - Remark: The concepts of mutable frame, accept and discard are somewhat
///   analogous to a transaction, commit and rollback respectively. However,
///   accepted frames are not immediately put into a single historical
///   timeline and they might organised into different arrangements. "Rollback"
///   would not make sense, since there might be nothing to go back from, if
///   we are not appending the frame to a history timeline. Moreover,
///   the mutable frame can be used in an editing session (such as drag/drop
///   session), which is something like a "live transaction".
