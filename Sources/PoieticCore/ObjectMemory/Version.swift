/// of the object itself or for a mutation of its owner.
///
/// Objects can be `frozen`, `transient` and `uninitialized`. The following table
/// describes what can be done with the objects in given state:
///
/// |                                | `uninitialized` | `transient` | `frozen` |
/// |--------------------------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
/// | Change invariant attributes    |     No          |   No     |   No     |
/// | Change versioned attributes    |     Yes         |   No     |   No     |
/// | Change unversioned attributes  |     Yes         |   Yes    |   No     |
