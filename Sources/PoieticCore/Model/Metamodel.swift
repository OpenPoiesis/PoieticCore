/// Object describing a design model.
///
/// The metamodel is the ultimate source of truth for the model domain and
/// should contain all named concepts that can be described declaratively. The
/// main components of the metamodel are:
///
/// - Object types â€“ list of types of objects that are allowed for the domain
/// - Components - list of components that can be assigned to the objects
/// - Queries - list of predicates and queries to provide domain specific view
///   of a design and of the design graph.
///
/// Reasons for this approach:
///
/// - One source of truth.
/// - Abstraction from persistence, inspection (UI), scripting.
/// - Transparency and audit-ability of the domain model.
/// - Reflection.
/// - Fair compromise between model DSL and native programming language, while
///   providing some possibility of accessing some of the meta-model components
///   through the native programming language identifiers.
/// - Potentially, in the far future, the metamodel or its parts can be compiled
///   for better performance (which is out of scope at this moment).
///
/// The major use-cases of the reflection:
///
/// - Documentation.
/// - Provide information through tooling to the user about what can be created,
///   used, inspected.
/// - There are going to be multiple versions of the toolkit in the wild, users
///   can investigate the capabilities of their installed version of the toolkit.
///
/// - Note: Each application is expected to provide their own domain specific metamodel.
///
///  - SeeAlso: ``Design/validate(_:)``, ``Design/accept(_:appendHistory:)``
